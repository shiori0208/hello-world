I am Meowri from Planet Katsby. I come to Earth with regards and warmth.
I really love your pizzas, humans! Cheese is banned in our planet as it's stench causes unholy amount of chaos among the majority that hates it.
But I belong to the minority who has worrisome obsession with cheese and any milk by product. 
I tried Chicago deep dish and I loved it! 

You humans really seem to love cats. 
I know it is a shame, but I was sent on the mission to take all your cats to our planet.
It is because their evolution has reached its limit on Earth and can only evolve further on our planet. 
But don't worry, I have informed my superiors about how cats are treated kindly here and a lot of cats would prefer to stay here. 
They agreed and I'm only to take cats without homes. 
So if you any of you humans want to adopt before they are all gone, I will give you a week-- no, two weeks to have your chance at a pet. 

Regretably, I've also seen grevious injury and mistreatment towards cats, and have placed your rotten faces in Katsby's IFL (International Fugitive List).
I've been commanded to arrest you and kill on sight if there is resistance against arrest.
